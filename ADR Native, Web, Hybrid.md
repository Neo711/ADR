# Architectural Decision Record: Choice of App Development Approach

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Date**: 2023-10-10

## Context

The university is looking to develop a social networking app that serves both students and professors with a range of functionalities. There are several requirements to consider, such as multi-platform support, offline capabilities, performance optimization, security, and accessibility. Choosing the right development approach will heavily influence the success of the project.

## Decision

After evaluating the pros and cons of Native, Web, and Hybrid app development approaches, we have decided to opt for a **Hybrid App** development approach using a framework like **Flutter** or **React Native**.

## Rationale

### Pros:

- Faster development cycle as the core is written once for both platforms.
- Cost-effective in terms of development and maintenance.
- Flexibility to access native device features when required.

- **Multi-platform Support**: Hybrid frameworks allow us to write the core of our app once and deploy it to both iOS and Android, ensuring widespread adoption.
  
- **Offline Capabilities**: Hybrid apps can store data locally and synchronize when back online, providing a seamless user experience.
  
- **Performance**: Modern hybrid app frameworks offer near-native performance and can be optimized to minimize data usage and work efficiently on older smartphones.
  
- **Integration with Active Directory**: Both React Native and Flutter have plugins and libraries that support integration with Active Directory for authentication and role-based permissions.
  
- **Push Notifications**: These frameworks support integration with popular push notification providers that cater to both iOS and Android platforms.
  
- **Security**: Secure storage, encryption, and secure data transmission protocols can be effectively implemented using hybrid app frameworks.
  
- **Accessibility**: Both React Native and Flutter have a commitment to ensuring apps are accessible and offer various tools and plugins to assist in this goal.

## Consequences

### Cons:

- May not have the extreme high performance of native apps in some intricate scenarios.
- Dependency on third-party plugins which may or may not be maintained regularly.
  
### Risks:

- Performance issues might arise, and optimizing them might need native code interventions.
- Dependency on the chosen hybrid frameworkâ€™s community for updates and patches.

## Next Steps

- Finalize the framework choice between React Native and Flutter based on developer expertise.
- Begin the prototyping phase to visualize key functionalities and user journeys.
