# Architectural Decision Record: Selection of UI Framework

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Date**: 2023-10-10

## Context

We're developing a social networking mobile app for the university, catering to both students and professors. The app's core requirements dictate it to be cross-platform, performant, secure, accessible, and offer offline capabilities. To ensure a cohesive and user-friendly interface, the choice of the right UI framework is crucial.

## Decision

After a detailed evaluation of various UI frameworks, we've decided to use **Flutter** for the app's UI development.

## Rationale

### Pros:

- Unified development process for both platforms.
- Access to a wide range of widgets to accelerate the UI/UX development process.
- Strong community support and frequent updates.

- **Cross-platform**: Flutter allows for the development of both iOS and Android apps from a single codebase, aligning with our requirement for widespread adoption.

- **Performance**: Flutter compiles to native machine code, ensuring optimal performance even on lower-end devices.

- **Rich Widget Library**: Flutter comes with a rich set of highly customizable widgets that can be adapted to align with university branding and aesthetics.

- **Offline Support**: Flutter, can effectively manage offline data storage and synchronization when the device gets back online.

- **Integration Capabilities**: Flutter has a growing ecosystem of plugins, including those for Active Directory integration and push notifications, which can cater to our specified requirements.

- **Security**: Flutter provides tools and packages to facilitate secure data storage, encryption, and secure network communication.

- **Accessibility**: The framework offers robust accessibility features, making it easier to implement text-to-speech, high contrast modes, and support for other assistive technologies.

## Consequences

### Cons:

- Being a relatively newer framework, some niche native features might require custom implementation or bridge modules.
- The team might require training if not familiar with Dart, the language used in Flutter.

### Risks:

- Potential hiccups in integrating with certain native modules or third-party services.
- Dependency on the Flutter community for critical updates and patches.

## Next Steps

- Conduct a training session for the development team on Dart and Flutter basics.
- Begin the UI prototyping phase using Flutter to visualize key functionalities and user journeys.
