# Architectural Decision Record: Permissions Management System

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Date**: 2023-10-10

## Context

The development of the university's social networking app requires specific attention to user roles and permissions. Given that the user base consists of both students and professors, with distinct roles and access rights within the app, it's crucial to design a permissions system that is secure, scalable, and maintainable.

## Decision

We will implement a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system integrated with the university's existing Active Directory system.

## Rationale

### Pros:

- Clear separation of user roles and permissions, making the system understandable and maintainable.
- Integration with Active Directory reduces redundancy and streamlines user management.
- Enhanced security by ensuring users can only perform actions they are authorized for.

- **Scalability**: RBAC allows us to easily scale by adding new roles or permissions as the app evolves without having to reconfigure existing roles.
  
- **Integration with Active Directory**: Many RBAC solutions can be seamlessly integrated with Active Directory, enabling us to leverage existing user roles and authentication mechanisms.

- **Flexibility**: With RBAC, we can fine-tune permissions at granular levels, ensuring that users only have access to the features and data they need.

- **Security**: RBAC, combined with the Active Directory's security measures, will ensure that our permissions system is robust and resistant to unauthorized access attempts.

- **Accessibility**: By using RBAC, we can easily track and audit user actions based on their roles, aiding in compliance and security checks.

## Consequences

### Cons:

- Initial setup can be time-consuming as roles and permissions need to be clearly defined and configured.
- Requires diligent maintenance when the app scales or introduces new features to ensure that roles and permissions are always up-to-date.

### Risks:

- Misconfigurations could lead to unauthorized data access or functionality exposure.
- Dependency on the Active Directory means any changes or issues there might propagate to our app.

## Next Steps

- Collaborate with the university's IT department to understand existing roles within Active Directory.
- Define clear roles (e.g., `Student`, `Professor`, `ClubAdmin`) and their associated permissions.
- Integrate the RBAC system with the app's authentication mechanism and test thoroughly to ensure proper access control.
